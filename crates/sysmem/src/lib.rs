//! Give memory the system allocator keeps after frees back to the operating system.
//!
//! macOS's allocator keeps freed large blocks mapped as "reusable": they no longer count in the
//! process's memory footprint but stay in its resident size until the system runs short. After a
//! raw decode (hundreds of MB of temporaries) that made the resident size climb towards the sum of
//! everything ever decoded. `malloc_zone_pressure_relief` (libSystem) returns those pages now.
//! Elsewhere (glibc, Windows) blocks this large are unmapped when freed: nothing to do.
//!
//! It also reports the machine's physical memory on Windows, which has no file or command for it
//! ([`total_physical_memory`]): the engine sizes caches and refuses exports that would not fit.
//!
//! This is Ember's only crate allowed `unsafe` (two FFI calls: `macos` and `windows`). Its API is
//! safe, and on failure or on other platforms it simply releases or reports nothing.
